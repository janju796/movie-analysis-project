The data was obtained from movie datasets such as;

    https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
    https://www.themoviedb.org/

Some of the datasets were useless independently but there were few exections.I had to merge some datasets to gain valuable information so as to understand the movie industry. The main variables used for analysis include;
    .Domestic and Foreign Gross comparison
    .Production budget and total gross comparison
    .The best genres based on movie rating
##Recommedations 
From the analysis it necessary for the company to;
    .Focus more in marketing in the foreign market since its more profitable
    .Think critically in budgeting phase and maintain the budget baseline while focusing more in marketing since having the bigger budget doesn't necessary equal to successful movie 
    Movies made should be focused on the top 10 genres
